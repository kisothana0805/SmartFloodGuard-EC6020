# SmartFloodGuard-EC6020
IoT-Enabled Indoor Flood Entry Monitoring And Alerting System For Residential Safety

🌊 SmartFloodGuard – EC6020

📖 Introduction

SmartFloodGuard is an IoT-enabled embedded system developed to detect indoor flood entry at an early stage and generate real-time alerts.
The system integrates environmental sensors, microcontroller-based processing, RF communication, and WiFi connectivity to minimize residential damage caused by unexpected flooding.
This project is developed under EC6020 – Embedded Systems Design.
